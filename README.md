## About

This crate provides one function, `enable_ansi_support`, which allows ANSI escape codes to work on Windows 10 and above.
Call `enable_ansi_support` *once*, early on in `main()`, to enable ANSI escape codes generated by crates like
[`ansi_term`](https://docs.rs/ansi_term) or [`owo-colors`](https://docs.rs/owo-colors) to work on Windows just like they
do on Unix platforms.

This uses Windows API calls to alter the properties of the console that the program is running in. See the [Windows
documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences) for more
information.

On non-Windows platforms, `enable_ansi_support` is a no-op.

## Example

```rust
fn main() {
    enable_ansi_support::enable_ansi_support();

    // use your terminal color library of choice here
}
```

## Minimum supported Rust version

The minimum supported Rust version (MSRV) is **1.41**. Unless there's a compelling reason to update it, it is most
likely going to stay at 1.41 forever.
